# Weight agnostic neural networks
## Notes
- kinda like specialized tissues (cells that differentiate from others and are meant to do one particular thing ex: skin cells). being good at doing something (at least better than others ) from birth/creation with no prior training/experience
- hence can perform a task to a good extent even with random weights
- ensembles of this model with different sets of random weights
